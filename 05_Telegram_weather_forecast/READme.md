# Bot provides the weather forecast for a specific city. You can choose any city based on your preference or location;

**Requirements:**

- Provide weather forecasts for every 3 or 6 hours upon the user's request
- The menu structure should be presented with buttons as follows:
    - "Weather forecast in {{city}}"
    - "With a 3-hour interval" / "With a 6-hour interval"
- The bot should work continuously, not just when you start the server. To achieve this, use any hosting service. The free version there is sufficient for this purpose.
